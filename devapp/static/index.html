<b>About the Dashboards</b>

These dashboards are generated by <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/build/cmd/godash">golang.org/x/build/cmd/godash</a>.

Issue information comes directly from GitHub.
To change something about an issue here, go to GitHub.

CL information comes directly from Gerrit.
To change something about a CL here, go to Gerrit.

The dashboard refreshes periodically.

<b>Release Dashboard</b>

The Go release dashboard shows
all open issues in the milestones for the upcoming release,
plus all open CLs mentioning those issues,
plus any other open CLs in the main repository.

The release dashboard is ordered primarily around issues in the
release milestone and the release-maybe milestone (for example,
Go1.5 and Go1.5Maybe). The maybe issues are shown in gray and
have [maybe] tags.

If a CL refers to a release issue in its description, the CL is shown on the
dashboard below that issue, with an arrow prefix (&#x2937;).
If a CL refers to multiple release issues, the CL is shown under each issue.

If a CL refers to no release issues, it is shown on its own, without an arrow.

<b>CL Dashboard</b>

The Go CL dashboard shows all open CLs.

The reviewer assignment for a CL is inferred from
activity on the CL. It can be wrong. To correct it,
reply to the CL with a comment starting with

	R=&lt;who&gt;

where &lt;who&gt; is the email address of the correct reviewer.
Past reviewers can be referred to without the email domain,
like in "git codereview mail -r", so R=rsc and R=rsc@golang.org
mean the same thing.

R=golang-dev makes the CL unassigned.

R=close removes the CL from the dashboard until the next
patch set is uploaded.

Giving a score of +2 or -2 makes you the reviewer of record,
regardless of R= lines. If that's wrong, remove your score.

If the CL author has made a comment or uploaded a patch set
more recently than the assigned reviewer (or if there is no reviewer),
the CL is "waiting for reviewer". Otherwise it is "waiting for author".
The person being waited for is shown in bold.

The days counts shown are the time since the last change in
"waiting for" status and the time since the CL was first uploaded.
If a CL has been waiting for reviewer for 10 or more days, the
reviewer name and day count are displayed red and underlined.

If a CL mentions issues, those issues are listed at the end of the
CL description as links.
