To create a working image:

* Create a new Infrastructure Container instance from the "base-64" image
* ssh in as root (account will have key info)
* Copy the build key to the machine at /root/.gobuildkey
* Download the stage0:

  cd /opt
  /opt/local/bin/curl -f -R \
    -z buildlet-stage0 \
    -o buildlet-stage0 \
    https://storage.googleapis.com/go-builder-data/buildlet-stage0.solaris-amd64
  chmod +x /opt/buildlet-stage0

* Install gcc:

  pkgin in gcc47

* Copy buildlet.xml to the machine anywhere
* Run as root:
  svccfg import buildlet.xml

Service should be running now.  Shut down the machine and create an image from
the Joyent web console.

If you need to debug, you can check status with:

svcs -x buildlet.xml

This will also give you the location to the log file.

If you need to change an environment variable, place this inside the start
exec_method element:

<method_context>
        <method_environment>
                <envvar name="EXAMPLE" value="foo"/>
        </method_environment>
</method_context>
