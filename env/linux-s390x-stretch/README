The docker image created from this directory can be used to cross compile go
from linux/amd64 to linux/s390x.

How to use:

$ docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/artifacts:/artifacts \
    gobuilders/linux-s390x-stretch build-release.sh $GIT_REV

This will make the built go artifact, go-${GIT_REV}-linux-s390x.tar.gz,
available in the directory you mounted as `/artifacts` in the container.
