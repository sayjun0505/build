The Makefile in this directory creates a Google Compute Engine VM image to run the Go
DragonflyBSD builder, booting up to run the buildlet.

make must be run on a Linux box with qemu and a few additional packages:

	apt-get install qemu-system-x86 qemu-utils expect genisoimage

To override the default Dragonfly version, set V= on the make command line:

	make V=600

To add new Dragonfly versions, add lines to the "Database" in the Makefile
and perhaps change the V= line to update the default.

	make upload-prod

builds and uploads the image. To replace an existing image, use

	make delete-prod upload-prod

s/prod/staging/ to test in the staging cluster instead.

The VM needs to be run with the GCE metadata attribute "buildlet-binary-url" set to a URL
of the DragonflyBSD buildlet (cross-compiled, typically).

	buildlet-binary-url == http://storage.googleapis.com/go-builder-data/buildlet.dragonfly-amd64

The buildlet rc script is lightly modified from ../freebsd-amd64.
