Hello gophers,

We have just released Go 1.19.

To find out what has changed in Go 1.19, read the release notes:

You can download binary and source distributions from our download page:

If you have Go installed already, an easy way to try go1.19
is by using the go command:

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with
